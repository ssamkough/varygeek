      <summary>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</summary>
      <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em> is a natural sequel to Donkey Kong for the
      Game Boy. The core gameplay loop and progression of levels is the same.
      The Game Boy Advance's new hardware explains a lot of the changes. Colored
      presents replaced the three collectible items of each level, and colored
      buttons replaced the temporary structures of Donkey Kong's levels. Each
      world gets its own palette, but Mario's stark colors are always present.
      New hardware also allowed for voiced cutscenes. I can't think of a game
      where Mario has more unique lines. There's actual music this time too, and
      some of it is great. The gameplay is tightly designed, as always, but some
      frustrations can scuff the experience. Unlike the last game, Mario vs.
      Donkey Kong gives you a real reason to perform well. You need to get all
      collectibles and finish fast to get rated a star for the level. That
      urgency clashes with the more enjoyable slow, deliberate gameplay. There
      are difficulty spikes where I experienced serious frustration, and I gave
      up trying to complete everything in the game. I recommend taking it easy.
      7/10

      <summary>Devil May Cry 5</summary>
      Devil May Cry 5 is the best spectacle fighter yet. I had played parts of
      the other Devil May Cry games, but I was always turned off by inconsistent
      gameplay or terrible, edgy presentation, including characters. Make no
      mistake, the fifth entry is still about grown men with anime hair chopping
      down demons. This time, however, the playground fantasies and rivalries
      has been mythologized. Cheesy shlock is delivered by well-voiced
      characters just as their tongues penetrate their cheeks. The graphics are
      some of the best of the generation, and the music, both juvenile alt-metal
      and orchestrated score, is put to good use. Of course, the real meat of
      these games is in their stylish, mechanically-deep gameplay. Dante has two
      transformations, four stances, four melee weapons, and four ranged
      weapons. Never mind the other three playable characters. Combat animations
      are appropriately visceral, satisfying, and spectacular for both allies
      and opponents. If you play casually, you might just find a button-mashing,
      anime spectacle. But if you're willing to meet the game in the middle,
      it's a replayable 9/10.

      <summary>Ico</summary>
      A lot of people cite this one as an influence; the director of The Last of
      Us, From Software's Miyazake, movie director Guillermo Del Toro, and
      Radiohead's guitarist Jonny Greenwood. It's successful on two counts.
      First, it's an exercise in minimalism; there is no HUD during gameplay,
      and so there are no resources (health, stamina, items, etc.) There is only
      one NPC and only one type of opponent in combat. Second, the aesthetics
      became iconic; the box-art, the windmill, the barren castle, the horned
      kid, and the hand-holding boy-and-girl. I think Zelda: T.P. took a lot
      from the aesthetics. I still think it's overrated though. The core
      gameplay â€”puzzle-solving with climbingâ€” just passes. The combat is
      terrible and a weird violation of the minimalist approach. Checkpoints can
      be brutal, and the escorted girl is often janky. People swear the heart of
      the game is the relationship between the main characters, but they're not
      real characters, just impressions. If you think a boy and girl wordlessly
      holding hands is just the deepest chit ever, this is the good shit.

      <summary>Shadow of the Colossus</summary>
      Surprisingly, this is a Playstation 2 game, and the graphics and systems
      push the hardware to its limit. Again, minimal design dominates; gameplay
      is just boss fights and traveling to those bosses. Compromises in the
      interface were made for basic health, stamina, and weapons systems. Any
      one journey can span the range of emotions: puzzlement, fear, awe,
      triumph, and regret. There is just enough background and moral uncertainty
      for a compelling story. You can taste Zelda: Breath of the Wild in its
      atmosphere and world. Director Fumito Ueda's second game matches the hype,
      and it ought to be experienced.

      <summary>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</summary>
      This one is weird too. All the sprites are bigger, so Mario runs slower to
      compensate. This might be the only real sequel Mario game. The story is
      that while Mario was fucking around in the last game, his private island
      (ðŸ¤”), which has a giant robot of himself (ðŸ¤”), was taken over by Wario.
      There's lore too; Wario and Mario were rivals from childhood, and Wario is
      jealous of Mario. No princess, no brother, no Bowser. Mario is just out to
      kick Wario's ass. There's even a reference to Friday the 13th's Jason...

      <summary>Beeny</summary>
      I just played Siactro's <em>Beeny</em>. It is a very simple platformer in
      the style of Donkey Kong Country. The average Flash game is more
      interesting, and Toree 3D is more fun. I think Siactro should not have
      charged for it. If you want to kill twenty minutes,

      <summary>Ion Fury</summary>
      Ion Fury is a solid boomer-shooter. It is a little more cover-based and
      tactical than something like Ultrakill or the newer Doom games. The
      dialogue is cheesy and cringy, but you can ignore it. Unlike a lot of
      retro-style games, it actually uses the old game engine of Duke Nukem.

      <summary>Tunic</summary>
      Tunic captures two things well: exploring cryptic games like the original
      Legend of Zelda or Milon's Secret Castle; and playing games before you
      could really read. I think it owes something to Fez too, but I have not
      played it. The combat is very Souls-like. I strongly recommend it. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
