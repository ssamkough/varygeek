This game deserves all the good reception it got. Again, the Game Boy Advance did wonders. All colors are put to use, and the sprite-work is top-tier. Actual music is now possible, and it hits. The simple addition of the R button allows Wario to do a very fun and fast charge like Samus' Speed Booster and Shinespark. Wario's limited health means the developers didn't have to make overly-difficult scenarios. A lot of the time-wasting and frustration have been smoothed out. In fact, there is now a mechanic that both rewards smart back-tracking and encourages speed. Wario pulls out his pimp-car for the first time and lays waste to archaelogical sites. "Excellent!"
