Devil May Cry 5 is the best spectacle fighter yet. I had played parts of
the other Devil May Cry games, but I was always turned off by inconsistent
gameplay or terrible, edgy presentation, including characters. Make no
mistake, the fifth entry is still about grown men with anime hair chopping
down demons. This time, however, the playground fantasies and rivalries
has been mythologized. Cheesy shlock is delivered by well-voiced
characters just as their tongues penetrate their cheeks. The graphics are
some of the best of the generation, and the music, both juvenile alt-metal
and orchestrated score, is put to good use. Of course, the real meat of
these games is in their stylish, mechanically-deep gameplay. Dante has two
transformations, four stances, four melee weapons, and four ranged
weapons. Never mind the other three playable characters. Combat animations
are appropriately visceral, satisfying, and spectacular for both allies
and opponents. If you play casually, you might just find a button-mashing,
anime spectacle. But if you're willing to meet the game in the middle,
it's a replayable 9/10.
