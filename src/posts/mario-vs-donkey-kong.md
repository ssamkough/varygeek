_Mario vs. Donkey Kong_ is a natural sequel to Donkey Kong for the
Game Boy. The core gameplay loop and progression of levels is the same.
The Game Boy Advance's new hardware explains a lot of the changes. Colored
presents replaced the three collectible items of each level, and colored
buttons replaced the temporary structures of Donkey Kong's levels. Each
world gets its own palette, but Mario's stark colors are always present.
New hardware also allowed for voiced cutscenes. I can't think of a game
where Mario has more unique lines. There's actual music this time too, and
some of it is great. The gameplay is tightly designed, as always, but some
frustrations can scuff the experience. Unlike the last game, Mario vs.
Donkey Kong gives you a real reason to perform well. You need to get all
collectibles and finish fast to get rated a star for the level. That
urgency clashes with the more enjoyable slow, deliberate gameplay. There
are difficulty spikes where I experienced serious frustration, and I gave
up trying to complete everything in the game. I recommend taking it easy.
