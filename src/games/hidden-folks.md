_Hidden Folks_ is video game _Where's Waldo?_ or _I Spy_, but unlike its book equivalents, it is interactive, animated, and large. From far enough away, and with the right focus, a village can look like a doll house. _Hidden Folks'_ aesthetics tap into that. While it can be fun to figure out riddles to find almost-literal needles in a haystack, the game will tire your morale and strain your eyes.
