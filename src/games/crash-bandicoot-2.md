**Crash Bandicoot 2** expands on and streamlines the original. Crash can move in new ways: crouching, crawling, sliding, crouch-jumping, and ground-pounding. The level-design is tight; gone are the long gauntlets of the first game, replaced by levels of carefully-spaced out obstacles, steadily increasing in complexity. This might be the most graphically impressive game for the original Playstation. There is still plenty of trail-and-error, but I never ran out of lives, nor did I need to use a save-state. The most frustrating moments are optional, and they're more reasonable to complete than the first game's. There are still poorly-visualized hitboxes and opponent-designs. Naughty dog killed something precious by not using the original game's musical theme. At least Bandicoot's sister represents woman coders better than most tech companies.
