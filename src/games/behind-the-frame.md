_Behind the Frame_ stood out among a showcase of games for Xbox, a beautifully drawn game about a woman artist. I'm sad to report that this is a barely-interactive, feel-good story with "cozy" aesthetics. What little passes for gameplay asks you to use an artist's paintbrush in a prescribed way and doesn't even trust you to make mistakes. I'm a sucker for the relationship at the heart of the story, and its convoluted telling is gratifying to make sense of until you realize much of it doesn't matter. Every time I thought the game would explore something dark, it came up short. Cozy games want to fixate on cats, coffee, sunflowers, and graphic design, not dark things.
