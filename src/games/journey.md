In retrospect, _Journey_ was a harbinger of so many barely-interactive, wannabe-art games. Its world is barren of any real characters or believable spaces. The history part of the story is numbingly simple and predictable. Everything spiritual and cultural is a scrubbed-clean amalgam of the "East". The actual journey is short and shallow. Achievements take the place of any interesting reasons to explore or replay. The gameplay and camera are finely tuned to make sure you press forward and the occasional button for hours. I don't think it's possible to fail at any point. That said, the whole thing is almost entirely redeemed by one genius idea and trick.
||Running into another journeying player is a great surprise. The comradery that spontaneously follows is one of the most beautiful experiences I've had playing games. How much of it is trickery, especially during the climax? Would players be as cooperative if there was a way to hurt or delay other players?||
