The interview with producer Testuya Mizuguchi in the second issue of A Profound Waste of Time got me to play _HUMANITY_. I was skeptical at first because his signature seems to be substanceless arcade game or game based on electronic music. It turns out _HUMANITY_ is a surprsingly dynamic puzzle game with an interesting narrative and tasteful electronic music that reminds me of Holly Herndon. On their own, the streams of customizable, Lemmings-like humanity are charming. They take on metaphorical meaning as the game goes on   which builds to some thoughtful ideas. Is it especially deep or ambitious? No. Was it worth all the time to complete the levels to perfection. Probably not. Is it one of the better ways to spend time gaming? Absolutely.
