I don't remember how I learned about __Rocket Knight Adventures__ as a kid, but I imagine I played it because it kind of looked like Sonic. It's a linear, arcade-style platformer for the Sega Genesis featuring a furry. What's remarkable between ordinary platforming and sword swings is charging up a jet-pack and launching off for distance and damage. I guess it's a lot like Sonic's spin-dash, but while the Sonic games promise high speeds and then grind you to a hault with off-screen obstacles, _Rocket Knight Adventures_ makes no such promise and is paced carefully. The charming, anime-like style see an idyllic kingdom of opossums sharing the world with machinist hell-scapes and a knock-off Death Star. The game has limited lives and continues, and its difficulty spikes in the last two stages. Use save-states. Play the Japanese version because it doesn't reserve end-game content for the hard mode. 6
