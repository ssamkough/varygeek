Technically and mechanically, this game is nearly the same as Wario Land 2. The interesting bit is the new direction; it adopts ideas from the metroidvania genre. You are expected to find new abilities and use them in past levels to unlock new areas. It's fertile ground for the series, but it worsens the frustrations the last game. Because abilities need to be unlocked, you start with an even less interesting Wario. Levels change depending on the time of day. I spent some time exploring a level only to figure out that it needed to be night not day, so I had to quit and restart the level, losing coins and progress. I dropped this game quick.
