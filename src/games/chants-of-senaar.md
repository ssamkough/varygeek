_Chants of Senaar_ has the allure of deciphering an ancient language, but it falls far short of the real thing. It's a product first. so it can't risk being nearly as difficult as actual decipherment. Its languages are severly dumbed down: only present tense, few differences in semantics, few differences in grammar, and only logograms for writing. There is no actual voice-acting, and speech is written in bubbles, so the distinctions between spoken and written language are completely absent. The paths to solving the linguistic puzzles are rigidly planned, and because the game can't risk any failure on the player's part, it has a non-diagetic system for confirming translations of words. Languages are ultimately windows into other cultures and times. _Chants of Senaar_'s world intrigues at first, but it ultimately comes off unbelievable, absurd, and censored. It's not hard to imagine a better game that uses real or constructed languages and cultures.  The maker of such a game just has to be willing to put off most gamers and trust the players that stay; art, not commerce.
