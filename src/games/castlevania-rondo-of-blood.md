__Castlevania: Rondo of Blood__ is both the end of the classical era for the series and the start of the new era. Gone are the Schwarznegger protagonists and here is Richter Belmont, Castlevania's own Jotaro Kujo; anime, recurrent, and endlessly cool. The few animated cutscenes finally make space for actual characters, and Richter and Dracula are worth it. The game's artists used the PC Engine to make some of the best pixel art and music of the era. Just watch a video of the first five minutes. The classical difficulty is still present, but it finally feels right. There are in-game walkthroughs for each boss, and there is an second playable character that serves as both the easy mode and a fun way to replay the game. If you play any classical Castlevania game, play this one. Skip the English voice-acting; play the Japanese version.
