__Super Castlevania IV__ reimagines the original game. The S.N.E.S. had the same resolution as the N.E.S. but allowed for bigger, finely-colored sprites. Consequently, the player-character takes up the most space of any console game in the series. In exchange, the whip-fantasy is indulged; Simon can whip in all eight directions, hold the whip loose like Sheik's chain in Smash Bros., and swing on the whip like Indiana Jones. Again, the music is some of the best on the system, and some of the environments are striking. There is no easy mode, but I almost finished the game regardless. The last level or two will bring you to save-states. The spectacle is still worth it. 6
