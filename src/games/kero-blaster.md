**Kero Blaster** is Daisuke Amaya's next big game after *Cave Story*. Although a collaborator was involved for this one, expect more singular vision, memorable characters, and strong aesthetic. Like its predecessor, *Kero Blaster* accomplishes a lot by being retro, but without technical limits in presentation or frustrations in design. While *Cave Story* drew on the *Metroid* and *Castlevania* series, this game draws loosely on things like *Mega Man* and *Contra*. Gameplay consists of simple platforming and fighting with different guns through missions that climax with challenging bosses. Crucially, there is no timer, so you are expected to move tactically, observing enemy patterns and switching to the right weapon for the job. The permanent upgrade system makes sure that if you are stuck, you will eventually become strong enough to win. It's simple, competent stuff. I wish it were more ambitious. 7
