**Crash Bandicoot: Warped**, the third one, is mostly more of the same. The design principles that informed the second game and its conventions are continued here. A whole third of the levels are vehicle or animal-riding gimmicks; they work, but it's probably the biggest difference between this game and the others. There are five (really four) new additions to Crash's move-set, but because they are unlocked throughout the game, few of the levels are designed for the new stuff. If you wanted to complete any of the games, this is the one to do it. The original game's music is still missing, and I feel the aesthetics are too far removed from their origins.
