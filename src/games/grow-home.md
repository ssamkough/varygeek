__Grow Home__ is a cute collectathon in a stress-free playground. Its core gameplay loop is just satisfying, unconstrained climbing and gliding. I don't think it would exist without Breath of the Wild. The secondary loop which consists of connecting a giant, sprouting plant to floating islands and collecting their upgrade-crystals. As you progress through the world upward, your character's abilities grow, and your skills grow with it. Your unique path is made concrete as you guide the plant into shape. It's very simple stuff, but I'm sure it took a lot of engineering to make it work at all, let alone making it feel good. My only complaint is that there is a lot of outdated geek humor, but it's balanced by stuff like labeling spiny plants "clactus".
