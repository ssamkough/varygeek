Surprisingly, this is a Playstation 2 game, and the graphics and systems
push the hardware to its limit. Again, minimal design dominates; gameplay
is just boss fights and traveling to those bosses. Compromises in the
interface were made for basic health, stamina, and weapons systems. Any
one journey can span the range of emotions: puzzlement, fear, awe,
triumph, and regret. There is just enough background and moral uncertainty
for a compelling story. You can taste Zelda: Breath of the Wild in its
atmosphere and world. Director Fumito Ueda's second game matches the hype,
and it ought to be experienced.
