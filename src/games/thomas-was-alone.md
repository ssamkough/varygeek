You've already heard of _Thomas Was Alone_, and you've already guessed the idea from its title and poster: a compelling story told with simple shapes for characters. It exposes how easily we project ourselves onto abstract objects, how swayed we are by a charming narrator, and how effective a narrative device something as simple as the "up and to the right" can be. Even the plot holds promise: a prison-break but with AI and messianic overtones. Sadly, sloppiness and shallowness get the better of this millennial's writing. This would work better as a movie; nearly everything would work just as well without the gameplay whose puzzles and platforming levels are always moved along before being fleshed out.
