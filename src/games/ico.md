A lot of people cite this one as an influence; the director of The Last of
Us, From Software's Miyazake, movie director Guillermo Del Toro, and
Radiohead's guitarist Jonny Greenwood. It's successful on two counts.
First, it's an exercise in minimalism; there is no HUD during gameplay,
and so there are no resources (health, stamina, items, etc.) There is only
one NPC and only one type of opponent in combat. Second, the aesthetics
became iconic; the box-art, the windmill, the barren castle, the horned
kid, and the hand-holding boy-and-girl. I think Zelda: T.P. took a lot
from the aesthetics. I still think it's overrated though. The core
gameplay —puzzle-solving with climbing— just passes. The combat is
terrible and a weird violation of the minimalist approach. Checkpoints can
be brutal, and the escorted girl is often janky. People swear the heart of
the game is the relationship between the main characters, but they're not
real characters, just impressions. If you think a boy and girl wordlessly
holding hands is just the deepest chit ever, this is the good shit.
