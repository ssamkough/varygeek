Environmental Station Alpha really tests the limit of how much a game can borrow from another. *Quiet protagonist in metal body fights and backtracks through underground, alien biomes to take out  sci-fi monsters and collect upgrades*. That describes Station Alpha as much as it describes any 2D *Metroid* game. So many details overlap too: strong environmental storytelling, atmospheric music, wall-climbing critters, etc. That said, *Station Alpha* still manages to find its own identity.

The visuals lean on PICO-8 more than any NES, SNES, or Game Boy Advance game, and the ambient music is memorable. The particulars of the upgrades and the small health pool make for a challenging but satisfying platforming-and-combat loop. It's tighter but more expressive than most of *Metroid*, and that's especially true for the boss battles. *Station Alpha*'s story does better with the outline of *Metroid* by ditching cartoon villainy, by using personal logs, and by maintaining a sense of mystery.

There are a lot of secrets and cryptic sequences that match stuff found in *Fez and Tunic*; the kind of thing internet communities froth over. They lead to substantial world-building information and optional content. I could only stomach some of it. To do it all would mean many hours figuring things out or tediously following a written guide.

I recommend *Environmental Station Alpha* if you like the genre or the spoiler-marked stuff. 7
