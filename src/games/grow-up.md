__Grow Up__ is a straightforward sequel. The world is bigger and more open. There are more abilities, and you can become very mobile, very quickly. Optional, linear challenges (like those in Super Mario Odyssey and Sonic Frontiers) put your learned abilities and skills to the test this time. You can make an even more unique playground in Grow Up by reproducing anywhere the plants you find which can fling, bounce, and launch you as well as stack on top of each other. Unfortunately, that tool is quickly made obsolete by the rest of the abilities. The talkative companion of Grow Home is replaced with an even more talkative and less funny one. The lack of technical improvement is disappointing; there is constant visual jank, and I ran into several bugs that affect gameplay.
