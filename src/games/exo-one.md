I found out about _[Exo One](https://exo-one-game.com/)_ among a list of games about building up and keeping momentum like _Sonic the Hedgehog_ games. The comparison is apt to a fault; gameplay consists of satisfyingly fast motion with ball physics which is frequently slowed to a frustrating crawl. What surprised me was the mysterious, creatively-told story its setting; if you're a nerd for exotic physics, exoplanets, _Interstellar_, and _2001: A Space Odyssey_, _Exo One_ has plenty for you to chew on. Despite plenty of beautiful and spectacular moments, the game comes up short with cheap-looking textures, 3D models, and other graphical shoddiness.
